# COVID Classifications Project

_In June 2020, a team from the NYU Digital Interest Labs worked on a research project around COVID-19 Classifications on each of the United States COVID-19 dashboards. We collected the data using RedCap. Then I cleaned, explored, analyzed, and visualized the data._  

I wrote up a short reflection on one of the classification topics on Medium, titled <a href="https://medium.com/digitalinterests/who-is-the-other-c28a6723cf32">Who is the Other?</a>. It focuses on an alarming trend that I noticed. Many states were not publishing aggregated COVID-19 data for all racial categories.
